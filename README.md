# Simulation-Modeling-project-using-ARENA
In this report, the supply chain of smartphones was simulated using ARENA software aiming at examining the most optimal resource allocation amongst this supply chain ranging from manfacturing to distribution process to the end user. 
The simulation model could be view in the **Smartphone modeling.db** file which could be open using ARENA SIMAN software 
Figure 1 demonstrate the image of the model.
