# Simulation-Modeling-project-using-ARENA
In this report, the supply chain of smartphones was simulated using ARENA software aiming at examining the most optimal resource allocation amongst this supply chain ranging from manfacturing to distribution process to the end user. 
The simulation model could be viewed in the **Smartphone modeling.db** file which could be opened using ARENA SIMAN software 
Figure 1 demonstrates the image of the model.
After being built, the model was executed in 3 replications so as to generate a simulation result report (Model_report file)
